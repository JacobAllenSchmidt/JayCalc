A very simple python calculator made using Tkinter.

Hope you engoy this MIT licensed calculator!

I know it works on Windows, but I'm not sure if it'll work on Mac or Linux.

Just run the command:
    python calc.py

or 
    python3 calc.py

in the directory where it is installed in.

Obviously, you'll need to have python 3 and tkinter on your system.
